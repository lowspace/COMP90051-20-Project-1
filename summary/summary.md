1. good literature review helps a lot. In this project, we have found a closely article and their method works well which inpsires us to try in the similar way.
2. don't set rules humanly without any academic support. At first, we tagged the results below 0.5 as 0, and above 0.5 as 1, since we considered the prediction prob > 0.5 represented the two people know each other. Howerver, this thought is naive, and the raw prob performs better. Maybe the raw prob contains much more information about the prediction prob, I think.
3. store the date instead of calculating it for each turn, AKA the trade-off between memory and CPU.
4. How to reflect our projects from a high-level persperctive? think about the interactions with the domain and the future.
